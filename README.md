# AI-Based 3D Molecule Visualizer 🎥🧪

An AI-powered system for **visualizing chemical molecules in 3D**, converting molecular data into interactive 3D models and enabling **experiential science learning** through visualization and voice-based interaction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Understanding molecular structures through textbooks is often abstract and difficult.  
This project bridges that gap by generating **3D molecular models** from chemical data and enabling users to visualize, interact, and explore molecules in a more intuitive way.

The system integrates **Python automation, Blender scripting, and basic web interfaces** to support molecule generation, visualization, and interaction.
